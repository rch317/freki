# Freki - Voron V2.4r2

Essentially starting this build from scratch and thought it would be fun to track
changes using klipper-backup as I go.

## The Build
Frame: LDO Space Gray (300m)
Z-Drive(s): LDO G2ZXL
A/B Drives: LDO ???
Vitalli CNC A/B Mount
Vitalli CNC Carriage
hartk1213 pin mod
Super Beefy Front Idlers
Beefy Z Idlers

## Toolhead
The current plan is to run the SB+G2E paired with the Nitehawk-36; though I have the SB should I decide to go that route instead. I like the NH36 for the USB port available which reduces the cable running to the Cartographer probe down to about maybe 5" of wire versus running a second longer line all the way back to the board. I am planning to run this as an umbilical setup, so the reduced wiring will definitely be handy.

I am eventually planning to change this at some point. I just haven't decided which toolhead I really want to run with. I've heard that there is a new SB coming out with the release of the Phoenix. So I might wait until that drops before I decide.

## Probe
Currently I am planning to run the Cartographer. I am using this on my other V2 and it works great, don't see much need to change anything here... I've read a lot of folks stating that it's really not needed. It might not be, but getting a heightmap within a few seconds of printing isn't causing me any serious delays.

## Colors
Using Polylite ASA Galactic Grey as the primary,  and Galactic Blue for the accent;  however I've printed almostd all of the parts in both colors so I can mix and match. I guess the only real reason the grey would be considered primary is the usage on the skirts.
